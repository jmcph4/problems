# Problems #
---

A collection of programming problems I have created for my own use. I am sharing them mainly for accessibility and the hope that others may benefit from them; however, they are not written with anyone else in mind (so they may seem somewhat quirky and disorderly).

## Format ##

"Everything is numbered here; The monster is Zero." *Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero*, 1965

The problems themselves are under the `problems/` directory. Each problem is numbered starting at one and proceeding forward. The directories under `problems/` are numbered accordingly. Each problem is entirely self-contained and does not (and **should not**) rely on any other problem in the set.

Each problem consists of at least a single text file, named `problem_n.txt`, where `n` is the problem number. This file contains the description of the problem, constraints, and documents attached materials (e.g. source code, static assets, datasets, etc.). This file follows the following format:

    TASKS
        [Brief description of the problem]

    CONSTRAINTS
        - [Constraint 1]
        - [Constraint 2]
        - ...
    
    MATERIAL
        [Brief outline of included files and their purposes]
